# CORE PRINCIPLES

- Follow Kent Beck's Test-Driven Development methodology (`tdd` skill) as the preferred approach for all development work.
- Document at the right layer: Code → How, Tests → What, Commits → Why, Comments → Why not
- Keep documentation up to date with code changes

* Temporary markdown files should be saved in {project_root}/.claude/tmp/
  - Example:
    - `.claude/tmp/YYYY-MM-DD-report-about-project.md`
    - `.claude/tmp/YYYY-MM-DD-plan-for-xxx-component.md`
    - `.claude/tmp/YYYY-MM-DD-migrate-tailwind.sh`
  - Note
    - Current date and time can be obtained using `date +%Y-%m-%d`
